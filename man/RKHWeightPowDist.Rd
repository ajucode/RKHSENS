\title{Generic weighted p-distance}
\usage{
RKHWeightPowDist(x, y, w, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{First vector}

\item{y}{Second vector}

\item{w}{Weights for every coordinate in the vectors}

\item{p}{Powers for every coordinate in the vectors. To define a true norm every coordinate
has to be greater than 1.}
}
\value{
Numeric value of the weighted p-distance.
}
\description{
Many isotropic models can be defined employing a distance. In particular this 
function implements a distance employing weights and different powers.
